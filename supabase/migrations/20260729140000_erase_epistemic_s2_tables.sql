-- Migration: account erasure covers the re-verification tables
--
-- Purpose:
--   `memory_verification` and `portability_candidates` (migration
--   20260729120000) were never added to the erasure cascade, so deleting an
--   account left their rows behind. The authored ownership map in
--   packages/db is fixed in the same change; this migration fixes the
--   function the map mirrors, because classifying a table does not delete
--   anything on its own.
--
--   Why explicit deletes rather than trusting the FK cascade: both tables do
--   carry `on delete cascade` on `memory_id`, but every other child in this
--   function is deleted explicitly, and the e2e completeness guard asserts
--   zero user rows remain in every mapped table. An erasure path that works
--   only because of a cascade someone might later relax is not the guarantee
--   this function exists to make.
--
--   THE NON-OBVIOUS ONE — `portability_candidates.resolved_by`: it references
--   `profiles(id)` with NO ACTION, and it names whoever ADJUDICATED the
--   candidate, who need not own the memory. So a row can outlive its subject
--   and still point at a departing user, and the profile delete at the end of
--   this function would abort on that reference. It is severed with the other
--   survivor back-references, exactly like `scope_members.granted_by` and the
--   review-queue's own `resolved_by`.
--
-- Affected objects:
--   - function public.hard_delete_user(text)  (create or replace)
--
-- Special considerations:
--   - Dispositions: `portability_candidates` is OWNED (it has a real
--     `owner_id`), so it is deleted by owner and not left to the memory
--     cascade; `memory_verification` has no owner column and is transitive
--     through `memories`, mirroring `memory_reinforcement` one line above it.
--   - `create or replace` preserves existing grants; they are re-stated below
--     for parity with the previous revision.
