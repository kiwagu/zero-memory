-- Migration: erasure leaves no words of the person in the audit log, and no key in the vault
--
-- Purpose:
--   Account erasure (`hard_delete_user`) kept every audit_log row of the person
--   and only cut the link to them, on the assumption that the log was content
--   free. It was not: the command bus recorded each command's payload, which
--   for a memory write is its text, so rows written before payloads became
--   content-free can still carry what the person wrote. Erasure now replaces
--   the payload of the person's rows with an erasure marker as well.
--
--   Erasure also deleted the person's provider-credential row directly, which
--   left the key itself in the vault. It now goes through
--   `revoke_provider_credential`, which removes the row and the secret together.
--
-- Affected objects:
--   - function public.hard_delete_user (restated; two statements changed,
--     everything else as before)
--
-- Special considerations:
--   - Rows of OTHER people that merely mention this person (by id in a
--     payload) are untouched here: payloads are content-free going forward,
--     and an id is not personal content.
