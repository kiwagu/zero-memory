-- Migration: fix hard_delete_user — do not null shared_by on the departing
--            user's OWN shared memories
--
-- Bug (surfaced on real data, not the synthetic e2e fixture): the erasure
-- cascade severs back-references with
--   update public.memories set shared_by = null where shared_by = p_user_id;
-- but `shared_by` always equals `owner_id` (sharing is owner-only), so this
-- statement also hits the departing user's OWN shared memories — rows that are
-- deleted a few statements later anyway. Nulling shared_by while the row is
-- still visibility='shared' violates memories_shared_lifecycle_check
--   CHECK (visibility <> 'shared' OR (shared_at IS NOT NULL AND shared_by IS NOT NULL))
-- and aborts the whole erasure. Any account with a shared memory could never be
-- deleted.
--
-- Fix: scope the shared_by sever to SURVIVING rows (owner_id <> p_user_id) —
-- which is what the cascade's own comment already says the back-reference
-- severs are for ("severing surviving rows, owned by others"). The departing
-- user's own shared rows keep shared_at/shared_by intact until they are deleted
-- wholesale by `delete from public.memories where owner_id = p_user_id`, so the
-- lifecycle check is never violated. Under the owner-only-sharing invariant
-- (verified: zero rows have shared_by <> owner_id) this statement now matches
-- zero rows, which is correct — there is nothing to sever on a survivor.
--
-- Everything else in the function is unchanged. `create or replace` preserves
-- the existing grants; they are re-stated for parity with the original.
